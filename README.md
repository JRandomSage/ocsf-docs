# OCSF Documentation
The ocsf-docs repository is intended to be the location where releveant proposals, documentation or other descriptive information for the schema is stored.
Documents such as OCSF Events.pdf or OCSF Objects.pdf are point in time snapshots of current work before public release.
Over time, documents will be organized based on version of schema.
