## How does OCSF relate to OpenC2?
OCSF and OpenC2 are compatible.

OpenC2 is a standardized language
for the command and control of technologies
that provide or support cyber defenses.
By providing a common language
for machine-to-machine communication,
OpenC2 is vendor and application agnostic,
enabling interoperability
across a range of cyber security tools and applications.
The use of standardized interfaces and protocols
enables interoperability of different tools,
regardless of the vendor that developed them,
the language they are written in
or the function they are designed to fulfill.
For more info on OpenC2, see
